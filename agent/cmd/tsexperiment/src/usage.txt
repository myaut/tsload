TS Experiment - standalone agent to run TSLoad experiments 

$ tsexperiment [global options] command [options and arguments]

Experiment constsists of current config and several "runs", that contain versions of config 
(maybe with altered parameters) and experiment results. Each run identified by it's unique 
number called runid. 

Where global options are:
	-e <experiment_path>
		Path to experiment root directory
	-d|-t 
		Enable debug or tracing

To run experiment, issue tsexperiment with subcommand run:
$ tsexperiment -e <experiment_path> run [-n name] [-s param=value] [-b]

Experiment config variables may be altered by using -s option, where param name is path 
to JSON node inside config. Some nodes may be aliased: 
	* tp - threadpools 
	* wl - workloads
	
I.e:
	* run -s tp:tp_test:num_threads=10
	* run -s wl:workload1:params:cycles:pmap:0:probability = 0.3
	
Additional subcommands:
 * workload|wl [-j] [wl1 [wl2...]]  
   Lists supported workload types with it's parameters
 * list
   Lists experiment runs
 * show [-j] [-l] [runid]
   Shows experiment information and config
   Options:
   		* -j - Show in formatted json format
   		* -l - Show as name-value list (useful to create run -s option arguments)
 * diff runid1 [runid2]
   Show differences between experiment configs identified by runid1 and runid2.
   If runid2 is ommitted, than tsexperiment compares config with current root config.
 * reset runid
   Resets current config to run's config identified by runid.
 * report runid [wl1 [wl2...]]  
   Show simple report about experiment run
 * export [-d dest] [-F csv|json|jsonraw] [-o option] [-o wl_name:option] runid [wl1 [wl2...]]   
   Export workload measurement data into text files
